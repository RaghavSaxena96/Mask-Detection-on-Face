# Mask-Detection-on-Face

Recognize whether a Person is wearing mask or not

Inspired by - https://www.pyimagesearch.com/pyimagesearch-gurus/

Use this simple python code to detect a mask on person face in workspace or crowd

Reason for uploading this is to help other as other repos are available  using  object detection libraries and codes which are pretty hard to deploy on system as a lot of dependencies have to be installed.This one is easy to deploy , so enjoy.
