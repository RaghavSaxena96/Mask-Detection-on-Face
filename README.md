# Mask-Detection-on-Face

Recognize whether a Person is wearing mask or not

Inspired by - https://www.pyimagesearch.com/pyimagesearch-gurus/

Use this simple python code to detect a mask on person face in workspace or crowd

Reason for upload is to help other as other repos available are using all object detection libraries and codes and pretty hard to deploy.This one was easy so enjoy.
